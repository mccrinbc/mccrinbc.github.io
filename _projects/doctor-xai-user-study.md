What started as an ambitious final year project with three of my closest friends, NanoRIMS took on a life of its own pretty quickly. I would be lying if I said we knew what we were getting ourselves into from the start. Truthfully, this project was **really** hard. At times, we had no idea if we were going to be able to finish it, or have it work for that matter. At the end of it all, we all learned a lot about Engineering, Intellectual Property, and ourselves. 

NanoRIMS, standing for a **Nano**particle **R**eactor **I**nstrumentation and **M**easurement **S**ystem, was to fill a niche within the biomedical sensor fabrication process. Biomedical research in particular has discovered a wide range of applications for gold nanoparticles, ranging from photodynamic therapy for treating skin diseases, photothermal therapy for cancer treatment, X-ray imaging, drug delivery systems, and biological/chemical sensing. Biomedical researchers are always seeking ways to optimize existing methods and develop novel applications for these useful particles. As a result, there needs to be a reliable and efficient method for synthesizing gold nanoparticles in small batches in order for research groups to be able to study their properties in a controlled setting. At the inception of NanoRIMS, small batch synthesis methods require human supervision and are labor intensive and error-prone. Therefore, **the purpose of NanoRIMS was to automate the synthesis and optical characterization of gold nanoparticles in the pursuit of reliability and consistency within biomedical sensing research**.
