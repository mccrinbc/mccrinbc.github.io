This paper is about the design of a 2D video game to fight against the stigma around depression.

Stigma is a common and serious problem for patients who suffer from depression and other mental illnesses. We designed a serious game to address this problem. The game enables player to experience and strive to overcome the disempowering aspects of depression during the journey to recovery. Through the game's interaction, player may gain a better understanding of the relationship between patient and the disease, which in turn may help to change the players' moral model with the disease model, and thereby diminish the stigma of depression.
