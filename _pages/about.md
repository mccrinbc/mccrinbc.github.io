## About Weina

Hey, I'm Brian! I'm an MASc student working on the automated detection of mild traumatic brain injury **(mTBI)** using diffusion tensor imaging **(DTI)**. Eventually, I plan on pursuing a PhD focused on medical imaging and the translation of diagnostic Machine Learning into Radiology for improved clinical outcomes. 

<!-- It is interdisciplinary research among AI, computer vision, information visualization (InfoVis), human-computer interaction (HCI), and medicine. An explanation is a two-way communication/interaction between AI system and its users, that's where HCI and InfoVis come in. -->
I'm especially interested in using explanations for better learning, for both AI (enable AI to learn better by forcing explicit representation) and doctors (learn from those explicit representations to accumulate experience from big clinical data).

Previously, I received a degree in **Engineering Physics, B.Eng** and am now working on my **Master's of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**, both from McMaster University. I work under Dr. Michael Noseworthy who is the director of the Imaging Research Labratory at St. Joseph's Healthcare, and a cross-appointed professor in the Department of ECE and School of Biomedical Engineering. 

Outside of school, I spend a ton of time climbing rocks, playing in a jazz/funk band, and learning how to kickflip.

  - It summarizes the recent technical advances that aim to make AI implementable in neuro-oncology.
  - These challenges involve the full life-cycle of developing an AI model, from obtaining the training data, to training the AI models, to evaluating and deploying the AI model in clinical settings.

  - It summarizes three user-friendly forms to explain AI's decision to end users: explaining using *features*, *examples*, and *rules*.
