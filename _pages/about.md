## About Brian

Hey, I'm Brian! I'm an MASc student working on the automated detection of mild traumatic brain injury **(mTBI)** using diffusion tensor imaging **(DTI)**. Eventually, I plan on pursuing a PhD focused on medical imaging and the translation of diagnostic Machine Learning into Radiology for improved clinical outcomes. 

<!-- It is interdisciplinary research among AI, computer vision, information visualization (InfoVis), human-computer interaction (HCI), and medicine. An explanation is a two-way communication/interaction between AI system and its users, that's where HCI and InfoVis come in. -->

Previously, I received a Bachelor's of Engineering (B.Eng) degree in **Engineering Physics** and am now working on my **MASc in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**, both from McMaster University. I work under Dr. Michael Noseworthy -  the director of the Imaging Research Labratory at St. Joseph's Healthcare, and a cross-appointed professor in the Department of ECE and School of Biomedical Engineering. 

Outside of school, I spend a ton of time climbing rocks, playing in a jazz/funk band, and drinking coffee that is way too expensive. Feel free to contact me at anytime if you're looking to collaborate, seek advice, or talk!

  - It summarizes the recent technical advances that aim to make AI implementable in neuro-oncology.
  - These challenges involve the full life-cycle of developing an AI model, from obtaining the training data, to training the AI models, to evaluating and deploying the AI model in clinical settings.
