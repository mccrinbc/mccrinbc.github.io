## The big questions
The general landscape of my research interests is the application of technologies in health/medical area. 

In particular, for health/medicine, I am interested in **neuro/brain related topics**. For technology field, I am interested in **Virtual Reality**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Human-Computer Interaction**. 

These areas actually have something in common: they touch certain profound topics,  such as:
- how the brain works (Neurology, Neuroscience, AI) 
- how we sense this world (VR, AI)
- how interactions shape or fake our conception (HCI, VR, neuroscience)
 

## Random thoughts on making decisions
So far I haven't come up with a specific research topic yet. I wish I could find my "Research Mr. Right" earlier so that I can speed up the PhD journey. The funny thing about choice is that once a decision is made, all other possibilities suddenly disappear. It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat: before making a decision, all possible worlds happily coexist. I think that's probably why I procrastinate for years. Another reason is that I'm satisfied with superficial knowledge, but would rather not dive into a specific area to taste the bitter beneath the sweet. Fortunately, my PhD journey encourages me to take such endeavor, and I look forward to seeing myself become an expert in some certain areas in medical related technologies.
