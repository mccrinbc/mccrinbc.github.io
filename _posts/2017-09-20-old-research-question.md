The following is the research questions I wrote in 2016. They serve as a starting point, so that I can come back to them from time to time. 

# Research Questions | June 4, 2016 

## Research Question 1:

Might biofeedback + VR be used as a non-pharmaceutical method for labor pain and anxiety reduction? How could data synthesizing using machine learning improve such effect?

## Research Question 2: 

How could virtual reality and machine learning help to facilitate diagnosis of cognitive deficit in neurodegenerative diseases?

## Research Question 3: 

How can machine learning and/or virtual reality visualization help to support medical decision-making?

## My general topic area

How could virtual reality and machine learning technologies help to improve medical diagnosis and treatment?

## What I want to figure out, in no particular order

- How could machine learning techniques be applied to automatically recognize medical imagings and data (such as EEG) so that to help predict the potential diseases?

- Could virtual reality help to recognize some cognitive deficit in neurodegenerative diseases, such as post-stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, etc? What is the advantage of applying virtual reality techniques, compared with traditional medical diagnostic techniques?

- Could virtual reality be applied to treat cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases? 

- Would biofeedback and virtual reality be effective in relieving labor pain which involves active muscle contraction and relaxation? If so, can this technology be applied during prenatal training for childbirth? How could such process be personalized using prenatal data by machine learning?

## Research Question 1: 

Might biofeedback + VR be used as a non-pharmaceutical method for labor pain and anxiety reduction? Could we use machine learning to achieve a better training effect during prenatal and labor?

## Research Question 2: 

How could the cognitive tasks in virtual environment help to early identify the cognitive deficit in neurodegenerative diseases? Will supervised machine learning help to automatically identify such trends in early stage of disease development in people with high-risk of neurodegenerative disease? Will a specifically designed training in virtual reality help to prevent or slow such trend?

## Research Question 3: 

Could virtual reality be used as a new interface for visualizing bioinformatic high-dimensional genomic data? Could we apply analytics tools (such as statistical analyses and machine learning) on these data within the virtual reality interface to help support clinical decision-making and personalized medicine?
