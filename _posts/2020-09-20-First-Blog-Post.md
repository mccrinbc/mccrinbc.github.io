I figure that as I start to pursue a more academic-oriented path, I should set up some type of website for it all. Seeing as I've read a bunch myself, there might be some grad student in the future that stumbles across my work and decides to Google my name. And if that's you, then welcome to the website!

I don't intend to use this very much, but I would love to keep this updated with the most relevant information I can give. We're at the cusp of PhD application season, and I'm excited to see what happens.

Until next time!
